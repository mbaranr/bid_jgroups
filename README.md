## Build and Run

* Run any bash file once (`server.sh` or `clinet.sh`) for compilation. Close the program right afterwards.

* Execute Java RMI command (RPC) as follows:

```
$ cd bin 
$ rmiregistry
```

* Run one front-end server and as may clients and backend servers (replicas) as desired.
    * System is able to handle full replica turnover, however, at least one needs to stay alive at all times for state preservation.
